Options include: block (block compromised user accounts), user_notification (send an email to user when we detect that they are using compromised credentials) and admin_notification (send an email with a summary of the number of accounts logging in with compromised credentials).
                            Action to take when a suspicious IP throttling threshold is violated. Possible values: `block` (throttle traffic from an IP address when there is a high number of login attempts targeting too many different accounts), `admin_notification` (send an email notification when traffic is throttled on one or more IP addresses due to high-velocity traffic).
